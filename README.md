# Tissue-and-Organ-Transplant-Ontology-TOTO-

TOTO is an ontology being developed for the domain of tissue and organ transplant systems. It is being made to:
-improve interoperability of registries related to tissue and organ donation
-support organ search and allocation tools through axiomatization that allows better querying
-aid research by tagging terms in organ donation literature
-provide clarity regarding the meaning of terms related to organ donation
-check for consistency within and between organ data registries by leveraging TOTO's axioms

TOTO is being built as an extension of Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the most widely used top-level ontology. It is also being designed for future inclusion in the OBO Foundry, a collection of BFO conformant ontologies relevant to the biomedical domain.
